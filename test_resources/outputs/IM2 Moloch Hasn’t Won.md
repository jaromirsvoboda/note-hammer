### IM2 Moloch Hasn’t Won
- Scott Alexander’s Meditations on Moloch. I will summarize here. Therein lie fourteen scenarios where participants can be caught in bad equilibria. In an iterated prisoner’s dilemma, two players keep playing defect. In a dollar auction, participants massively overpay. A group of fisherman fail to coordinate on using filters that efficiently benefit the group, because they can’t punish those who don’t profi by not using the filters. Rats are caught in a permanent Malthusian trap where only those who do nothing but compete and consume survive. All others are outcompeted. Capitalists serve a perfectly competitive market, and cannot pay a living wage. The tying of all good schools to ownership of land causes families to work two jobs whose incomes are then captured by the owners of land. Farmers outcompeted foragers despite this perhaps making everyone’s life worse for the first few thousand years. Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum: If you want peace, prepare for war. So we do. Cancer cells focus on replication, multiply and kill off the host. Local governments compete to become more competitive and offer bigger bribes of money and easy regulation in order to lure businesses. Our education system is a giant signaling competition for prestige. Science doesn’t follow proper statistical and other research procedures, resulting in findings that mostly aren’t real. Governments hand out massive corporate welfare. Have you seen Congress?
- The optimizing things will keep getting better at optimizing, thus wiping out all value. When we optimize for X but are indifferent to Y, we by default actively optimize against Y, for all Y that would make any claims to resources. Any Y we value is making a claim to resources.
- If someone has consistently good luck, it ain’t luck.
