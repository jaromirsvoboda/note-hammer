### A voting theory primer for rationalists
- elucidates
- Vote-​ splitting /​“ spoiled” elections. Adding a minor candidate causes a similar major candidate to lose. Very bad because it leads to rampant strategic dishonesty and in extreme cases 2-​ party dominance, as in Duverger’s Law. Problematic in FPTP, resolved by most other voting methods.
- Center squeeze. A centrist candidate is eliminated because they have lost first-choice support to rivals on both sides, so that one of the rivals wins, even though the centrist could have beaten either one of them in a one-on-one (pairwise) election. Though the direct consequences of this pathology are much less severe than those of vote-splitting, the indirect consequences of voters strategizing to avoid the problem would be exactly the same: self-perpetuating two-party dominance. This problem is related to failures of the “favorite betrayal criterion” (FBC). Problematic in IRV, resolved by most other methods.
- Chicken dilemma (aka Burr dilemma, for Hamilton fans). Two similar candidates must combine strength in order to beat a third rival. But whichever of the two cooperates less will be the winner, leading to a game of “chicken” where both can end up losing to the rival. This problem is related to failures of the “later-no-harm” (LNH) criterion. Because LNH is incompatible with FBC, it is impossible to completely avoid the chicken dilemma without creating a center squeeze vulnerability, but systems like STAR voting or 3– 2-1 minimize it.
- Condorcet cycle. As above, a situation where, with honest votes, A beats B beats C beats A. There is no “correct” winner in this case, and so no voting method can really do anything to avoid getting a “wrong” winner. Luckily, in natural elections (that is, where bad actors are not able to create artificial Condorcet cycles by strategically engineering “poison pills”), this probably happens less than 5% of the time.
- FPTP (aka plurality voting, or choose-​ one single-​ winner): Universally reviled by voting theorists, this is still favored by various groups who like the status quo in countries like the US, Canada, and the UK. In particular, incumbent politicians and lobbyists tend to be at best skeptical and at worst outright reactionary in response to reformers.
- Utilitarian measures, known as VSE, are one useful way to evaluate voting methods.
